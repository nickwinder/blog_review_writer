## Altra Olympus 6 Summary

#### Outsole
The outsole of the Altra Olympus 6 features a combination of partially exposed foam and Vibram Megagrip rubber. An improvement over version 5 addresses the previously reported issue of the rubber peeling away from the foam. The lug depth is approximately three to four millimeters, which is acceptable but not aggressive enough for very muddy conditions; thus, the shoe performs best in dry to mildly wet environments. The exposed foam may be vulnerable to damage from sharp rocks over time.

#### Midsole
The midsole consists of compression-molded EVA foam, which feels relatively soft, although not as soft as some bouncier foams found in newer models. The zero-drop design maintains the same height in both the forefoot and heel, with a stack height of 33 millimeters. Initially, the shoe feels firm underfoot, and the rocker design helps transition from heel to toe. However, on rocky terrain, the lack of ground connection can be unnerving. On flatter and gentler terrain, the shoe performs well, allowing your feet to roll along smoothly, making it particularly suitable for ultra-distance runs.

When attempting to increase speed, the bulkiness of the shoe can feel cumbersome, leading to a sensation of heavy legs. The shoe weighs approximately 350 grams for a US size 9 (potentially 355 grams with mud). The flatter outsole encourages corrections if you land on the inside or outside of your foot, which may feel unnatural to those accustomed to barefoot running. The rocker also helps maintain momentum, especially when fatigued.

#### Upper and Fit
The upper of the Altra Olympus 6 has a notably wide toe box, with a squared-off area for the big toe and sufficient room for little toes. Flexibility in the lacing allows for added comfort, whereas the midfoot features overlays that add stiffness, which may require a break-in period for wider feet. The heel design includes cushioned bumpers made from a material resembling faux leather, which initially posed some discomfort but became manageable with a proper lace lock.

The shoe has medium depth—more than the Superior but not as much as the Lone Peak. The wide, flat laces stay securely in place, and the tongue's design minimizes pressure on the top of the foot. The toe box has some depth, and the toe cap keeps the upper material away from the toes, enhancing comfort during longer runs.

Breathability is moderate; the numerous overlays provide protection but can hinder airflow. While I didn’t experience excessively hot feet, this shoe is not the most breathable option available.

Sizing is true to size; however, I found it slightly long. For those needing extra toe room for ultra races, a half size up may offer a more comfortable fit. This shoe likely suits runners who are not used to the barefoot scene and are looking for a reliable option for long ultra runs. It may not be ideal for training, as the lack of ground feel suggests it’s better reserved for races and very long runs.

#### Durability
Historically, the Ultra Olympus has encountered issues with upper tearing and the outsole separating from the foam; however, the current model features thicker, more flexible upper materials and claims to have improved the bond between the Vibram outsole and foam. The toe bumper provides protection against impact, and the overlay materials along the sides add further safeguarding. While the outsole is likely to wear out first due to its partial coverage and minimal rubber surface area, the overall durability seems improved. Users should avoid extensive road running to extend the shoe's lifespan, but the firmer foam is expected to hold up well for hundreds of miles.

In conclusion, while durability and fit are critical considerations, it appears that many durability issues from previous versions may have been addressed. The Altra Olympus 6 combines a high stack height and flexible materials to create a shoe that suits ultra-distance running, especially in less technical terrain.

### Altra Timp 5 Summary

#### Outsole  
The Timp 5 outsole features Vibram rubber, offering excellent grip across various terrains, including mud, snow, and dry trails. The lug design performs well on rocky and technical trails but is less effective in deep mud. Compared to its predecessor, the Timp 4, the outsole is significantly improved, providing durability and enhanced traction. While the outsole is a strong point, like most trail shoes, heavy use on rocky surfaces may wear it out faster.

#### Midsole  
The Timp 5’s midsole is composed of a firm Ego Max foam with a stack height of 29 millimeters. While the shoe is zero-drop, the stiff midsole and toe rocker create a ride closer to a conventional shoe than a barefoot one. The rocker design aids momentum, particularly on uphills and level terrain, but may reduce natural foot engagement and activation over time. Ground feel is minimal due to the stack height, which may not appeal to minimal runners but suits those coming from traditional cushioned footwear. The stiffness reduces flexibility but helps alleviate foot and leg fatigue during long distances.  

#### Upper and Fit  
The upper is constructed from a tough, nylon-like weave with welded overlays for added protection against scrapes and scuffs. The toe box allows decent toe splay but is less accommodating for wide feet compared to other Altra models, especially near the little toes. Depth is shallow, creating a snug fit that some may find restrictive. Replacing the 4mm insole with a thinner option can alleviate this issue, improving comfort for those with wider or higher-volume feet. The midfoot and heel provide a secure and stable fit, with a relatively stiff heel counter that locks the foot in place but may feel restrictive for some.  

The upper balances breathability with durability. While the overlays add protection, they slightly hinder airflow, making the shoe moderately breathable. True-to-size works well for most runners, though those with wide toe splay may prefer trying a half size up.  

#### Durability  
The Timp 5 demonstrates marked improvements over the Timp 4 in durability. The Vibram outsole is more robust, and the tougher upper materials resist tears and abrasions effectively. However, the welded overlays, while protective, might peel over time, though this is largely cosmetic. The firmer midsole adds longevity, making the shoe suitable for multiple long-distance runs or increased mileage. While the Timp 5 may not reach the durability standards of brands like Salomon, it is expected to last up to 500 miles, a reasonable benchmark for trail shoes.  

#### Conclusion  
The Altra Timp 5 is a standout ultra-distance trail shoe, offering improved durability and traction compared to its predecessor. While it sacrifices flexibility and natural foot engagement, it excels as a stable, protective option for rocky and technical terrain. Its lightweight design (278g for a men’s US 9) and Vibram outsole make it a solid race-day choice, though it is less suitable for daily training. Minimal runners may need to adjust to the firmer, conventional feel but could still enjoy the shoe’s performance in ultra-distance races or rugged environments. For the best results, balance use with foot-strengthening exercises and barefoot walking to maintain foot health.
