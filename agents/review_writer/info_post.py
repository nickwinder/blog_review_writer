## My Opinions on Cushioning in Running Shoes

Can conventional shoes make you faster?
When comparing conventional vs. barefoot shoes, 9 times out of 10 you’ll run faster in conventional shoes. 

There are many reasons, but the simplest one to understand is related to cushioning. 

When you add 20-40mm of cushioning, you’re essentially lengthening your leg. 

A longer leg and soft cushioning underfoot allow you to lengthen your stride. And speed is just a factor of stride length and cadence (steps per minute). 

So, if you keep your cadence the same and lengthen your stride, you’ll be faster! 

No wonder shoes have been growing in recent years, eh? 

### More training miles

Cushioned running shoes can also allow you to get more training miles in without stressing the feet, thus improving your overall general fitness. The key thing here is that you've improved your general fitness, but you're neglecting your general health, and your foot strength is not improving.
